Goals: Art, Project development pipline structure (learning to reuse code, streamline things)
-Manage camera resolution

Goal: Release the 40 wave mode, in one area

Next time : ask for henry for a book about OS, it apparenlty has one of his favorite quotes
join icpt team or something programming team

Repeatable architectures nad reproducable builds
Computer graphics, 
everything flow from underlying data structures, how i model them is how algorithms work...
Design document; design diagram

Important notes: 7/1 for optimizing
idea: remove collider on tiles and replace with a ray cast function to not need colliders?... but right now fps is fine

Questions:
-Is towerInfo.TowerInfo.whatever expensive?
-BuildingStructureHandler, is using static being bad?
-Shopclass abusing singelton with BuyItme? should use event,
-Shopclass how to like check if static instance exist like with exceptions or something...
--try get? debug error, never use debugger tbh
-Lot of my system involves me not forgetting cvertain things. i just get errors? just 

--My player tower script userlogic i think has script that returns its SO but how could i check it?

--My tower detruction call multiple other object kidna like shopclass using many singletons...
-Going to do this system atm, have bullet prefab with emptpy variables, when i spawn one it will get data and get reference to it is this expensive? I don't think it a big deal in my game since object pooling but 

-Is i using virtual wrong, like requring the default implentation as well? 

-Learn design patterns more?
-Devops vs software engineer...

Shop

NOTE: Make sure there is tile covering everywhere, I don't see how player could click on not a tile in game

UI:
Main UI
---------
Health, Currency, Fastfoward

Tower UI
---------
Health, Damage, Sell Cost, Upgrade

Tower Upgrade System
Districts?: If certain towers are built together than bonuses can apply
Support Towers

How many towers in game? 35, but a lot of upgrades, 5 upgrades???

Will have one purchasing manager but the shops will be different when player moves to new area
The create items function (just like in the 'ShopGame') will be used to add elements in, add tabs for new towers in specific areas (this for later)

Need to have camera movement with mouse

Conditions for new towers, add towers in through scripts, codemonkey way.  This will help with adding towers the scroll bar and spawning towers on grid

Need to play that isometric tower defense game again, to see how they did it


========
6/7/2023
--------
need to add camera panning with mouse

Thinking about how to add items to the ShopList and for Spawning.  How do i set up GameAssetsHolderManager, dictionary with SO?

Will upgraded towers be their own SO?
When will shop add new items?  Just based on player currency?  Wave number?

Shop currently works

!!Need to get CodeMonkey Utilities script thing


What will enemies be like, simple tower that shoots one thing to closest player tower and another tower that is aoe
This will be reusing methods for the player tower since they also shoot the same way
EnemyAI Path will be a prefab with a script on it, just attach it to all enemies in the certain zone


So enemy towers are like real gameobjects that can float along, have to test that.  They will have same stats as tower
Player towers are just tiles, upgrades are new tiles or just replacing the sprite?  How does this relate to the SO?  I need SO for sure

I am thinking, tile initially gets data from SO... all the data including sprites.  When the player clicks on that tile to upgrade and stuff =>
=> then it will look at SO for the new upgraded sprite

Enemy towers will just have gameobject sprite as their image, lets just give them an SO

So all the basic info towers have will be struct.  The player tower will have additional information such as price buildspace and such


))Scope creep?  Lanes that are 3x3 so enemies can have 3x3 towers? or just several 1x1 towers?

Watched video to understand tilemap more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TY0F7Zm6Lc

Will make 40 level wave prototype without URP.  Will work on upgrading later

Going to add mouse panning and try to make tower functional with enemies too

Tilemap Optimization: Put unity tiles in individual mode while editoring but put it back to chunk when buildilng...
- ALSO put the tiles in a sprite atlas or something....

Have shop glow new tower when player gets cetain amount of currency
Have to manually set tiles to have to be on certain layer in order for blocks to look like they are behind or infront of a wall

Made shop work and camera work...

How is player gonna click on UI without the camera moving all over the place?  Maybe have player need to press a button that let games know okay, move camera?

Make tower show radius, do i have to manually tell game where the center of the tower is?

I think I do, will have to have two towers, square and notsquare. 		

Things to do:

make tower radius with 1x1 tower
make basic tower shoot, 
make placing tower work (multiple tile take up),
make tower radius with other tower sizes


make shop button work, 
make description work, 
make adding towers work (also adding the notification of a new tower), 
make wave system somewhere (including spawner and figure out how waves work...)


THINGS TO FOCUS ON:
Spawn only one ring, or figureout some kinda of system to handle that.  Need deslect thing to work

Make a second tower because hover thing is making things complicated


Tower ofo same time not working for some reason... I think i need tilebase reference, not if towertile is same

Wait how do i even make tower hit closest thing correctly in a 2d environment?  Okay having 2d sprite at angle is my solution kinda 

Okay i have attackhandler on towerstruct but i think can refactor later for support towers
Probably have abstract class of basic towerradiusmanager and then classes for attacking or supporting
Base abstract class is just get things in radius?

Need to change attack radius to be overlapping the actual circle. Spawn the circle with the attack handling sript on it.  Maybe play a little animation when building tower to give some time to spawn

Okay so i fixed radius thing

Maybe have a mechanic where player can send an airplane to uh send bombs to heal player towers or damage enemies
Change camera size?

Need to add spawn point of bullets.  Maybe cool for towers with multiple spawn points

Gonna see if i can make towers preplaced in editor without casuing error, it annoying for testing and probably future feature

Redo code: Turns out, tile, is not a good place to have logic in
Tower and radius on the cursor when player buying will be a seperate object...

Need to go on website called the Medium to see how i can make tiles store individual data...


Okay. Maybe this, have grid handler handle sprites but spawn in the radius destroying thing there.
Have to add custom hitbox to player towers that allow enemies to hit the player towers and allow player to destroy them

I think spawning radius with other towers not issue since it all be custom

Destroy tower should be a menu option actually, when clicking on it.
Made helper function to destroy any tile at specific location, used in TowerLogicHandler and in destroying tower in the menu

Need to work on shop so i can make mouse switch from buildng mode to just clicking mode...

REVAMP: Make game entergunegon 2d look but its actually 3d

The camera will be rotated to look isometric and sprites will have to be isometric as well, not sure how it will look when tower 
which will be issue at all angles


Review what I have done: Camera, UI

Implementing Old Systems back into this new revamp

Okay done...

Try to do the new tile system with spawning gameobjects instead of the dumb map
I wonder how I can do elevated layers but worry about that later, can just spawn tiles on their or put them there manually

Okay need to learn more about optimizing rn, learn unity occulsion culling
When player go to new area, it will have to be unity dots i guess

Need to make every other tile a different color bvecause grahical bug, colliders touching each other or something...

So far the only input from player is just using the mouse, and then it will be R to rotate... and escape to escape things...

Need to have multiple sprites for cursor and the prefab in the game in a tower. cursor sprite does not work with an ingame tower sprite

Okay basically finsihed game states..., just some todos for the pause vicotry and gameover screen


When player rotates camera, i guess i gotta just change the sprite to the next rotation versino cause they could have the truned sprite when they turn
an object in the normal view angle



6/20/2023
Forgot to push at main pc so doing what i can

Important to do: when making cursor spirte move it top left a bit so it line up with in game cursor placement

Should ask about having two calsses diffenet script or just one big ol scrip

schedule meeting with Henry AND COMPILE LIST OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING INTERNSHIP PSTUFF TOO JUST IN CASE

figure out save system

Quality Of Life: Make camera center on tower when clicked on?

Future: 
make moving camera require click so can click stuff near edge, 
make cooler towers (with multiple attack radiuses, how to customize where radius spawns...)
-If multiple attack radiuses, just have two BaseTowerAttackHandler
Make that use of basic polymoprohsm or whaetver

Tower should have a little preview of where it can be placed at... but probably need to work on tower sprites before working on it

ATM can select both player and enemy towers... maybe have it in some encylcaedia or something

Handle bullet travel behavior in tower and damage in tower
Handle bullet sounds explosion animations on bullet

Could i make the bullets be in 3d space to handle the isometric perspective? I think i should

Unity apparently spawning and destryoing item expensive, learn to pool...

Would my projectiles be 3d or 2d, i think 2d cause i can only draw that... but can give 3d collider.....

Reason why layer can be flexible is that enemy towers can support other enemy towers... just like player support player



Tower shooting ideas: hit whatever it touch first, hit specific target no matter what it touches


Make tower shooting async i guess

========
6/22/2023
--------
Tower attack behavior requires me to drag and drop the script into each SO which is fine i guess

So prefabs will need to have their behavior attached along with their tile management thing
Customizing behavior on the individual TowerBehaviorScript

Reserach little more on interfaces...

had to make tirggerenter2d into 3d cause cannot rotate 2d like that...

Should really set up error log messaging... like cause lot of things could go wrong because i forgot ot set up something

Making another script so the attack ariuds handles getting the components and stuff...
Could refactor base tower and enemy tower but do that later.

Instead of layers used tags isnteadf....


Going to refactor now, enemy tower dnot have all things needed cause I tired when copy pasting and not thinking

To destroy tower, have to work on more descirption info spawn a button that allows player to delete towers
Also figure out how the upgrade system works....

make enemy move through the points

The description info should show the towers health, for enemies, and damage

For now, no mini map

Had grid duplicating somehow

figure out save system, how to make certain tiles buildable, like how can i design maps... learning about unity editor scripting
how do i limit scripts or like prevent certain things from happening...

Save system what i need to save:
What tiles are not buildable, what towers are on each block, each tower's health and upgrades?, currency, wave level... (just sounds like a lot of dictionaries)
	I was thinking that upgraded towers are their own scriptable objects, their own instance...
	The new towers are different prefabs, every upgrade just have unique upgrades...

but not shooting, make art... BUT UPGRADE TO NEW URP FIRST, just literal cubes
Got to learn object pooling 
game over and win condition (super basic level win managenemtn)

//Based on wave levels...
make adding towers work (also adding the notification of a new tower), 
make wave system somewhere (including spawner and figure out how waves work...) (saw video on using points so spawning enemy costs
points and the game just randomly spawn enemies and uses the points)

Upgrade system, just realized that if click on more info for tower, there should be a tab to see the tower upgrades as well, so the UI i have now
is pretty good actually

Quality Of Life: Make camera center on tower when clicked on?

think about how saving will work because the systems is going to need to work with it...
Object pooling, save system, unity editor
 what is bitmasking...




========
6/29/2023	
--------
Figured out object pooling

Fixed rotation bug

Unity

saving is just if have certain tower, store the values in each tower, so dictionary with towers, towers some how store upgrades




========
6/29/2023	
--------

Object pooling, save system, unity editor

Object pooling, each tower will each have their own small pool of bullets, of around like 3 or 4.  I can't imagine why they would need more than that, maybe the really long range towers and projectile is slow...

What is my upgrade system gonna be, like just each upgprade is its own prefab? that can't be right...
Need to use some kind of hashmap or something to store all the upgrades a tower has
- upgrades like BTD6, i guess it depends on what the upgrades do
- if the upgrades fundamentally change the tower then yea it a new tower...





What kind of towers to have in my demo
Player: Basic tower, that can be upgpraded a lot?
	Long range tower
	Artilary tower, chooses where it shoots

Enemies:
	Tower that shoot in straight light
	Shoot in a circle
	Tower that spawns more towers
	Flying tower?
	Underground tower
	Big health tower is like skyscraper that break down into layers
	Fast towers

Notes on profiling... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXRURWwabF4 
-------------------------------
}Budget formula of game fps is 1000ms / target frames per second
60 fps : 16ms
30fps: 32ms

}Profiling in editor can be misleading as editor will consume a lot of budge
Best thing to do is build game and profile in the build
- Make sure development build is checked and autoconnect profiler (as soon build start profiler is connected)

!!! In project settings (under 'Player' but this video from 2020), make sure 'Run in Background' is unchecked

Set frame rate in Unity?
if i do not set it, it is as high as possible in desktop but capped at 30 on mobile


Profiling is time consuming so should be done at certain points of game.  Make sure when profiling to save what i have profiled so i can compare 
in future profiling.  Do not wait till last minute
Profile in sustained mode? 
Smart loading strategy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrYPkSIvpIw this video is about draw calls, making untiy perform better with models or something
- combine meshes? static meshing, so i can use that on my tiles since they will not be moved
- GPU instancing?

==========================================


========
7/2/2023	
--------
Towers will consist of 2 game objects, one is tower image with the collider that allows player to click on them and other is the attack behavior
the attack behavior is where the radius will spawn, this is how i can place where the tower radius will spawn... by moving where the
attack behavior is since the radius attack will spawn as child of attack behavior

Working on skill tree...

Each tower should have their own skills...
Fixed selectionmanager bug (more like understanding my own code that I actually made myself)

Might refactor my stats to follow OneWheelStudio idea, NVM

Going to try my way with array tries kinda of system
----------------------------------------------------
Right now just do array kinda of system but in future use tries

Tower prefab will have component based script (skills component script) that holds all the possible upgrades they could have
-In future the skills component script will be a trie structure and somehow the UI will have to read that, it probably not expensive, like 
its a computer, it can do things fast...
-Also skills component script can be comprised of other smaller classes I guess
skillUI is own class, it will spawn in UI and read the selected tower's skills component script

saving should be easy since it is just how many points in what array i guess...


Have to think what kind of upgrades so i know how the code is architectured a bit
-----------------
Early game path:
Increase stats, change projectile speed

Late game path
Change Tower from one shooters to two shooters, make shooters stronger
-----------------

Nodes, so they hold the function of what to upgrade and whatnot and they can make the next node selectable or not


JK, just doing an array that hold skill classes, if increase value then get the whatever 


(Below is just the other reserach throughout the day)

So following code monkey way:
-------------------------------
Each tower has their own skill tree class
There will be one unique canvas for every type of class, (just use game asset holdler?)..., but the UI will read based on the clicked on tower
Maybe it is just a prefab that can have a single instance somehow...

Menu manager or whatever can handle UI upgrade tree, it will just spawn in the skill tree thing 
-Can do composition for these skill trees

Working on making basic UI for skill tree


To save game, all i need is each tower current health at the start of a wave and location

Here is old note: 'saving is just if have certain tower, store the values in each tower, so dictionary with towers, towers some how store upgrades'


Need to polish game, like attack ranges are not visually correct at all

Work in sequal...
How to make unity UI scale for project scope, make it into its own scene??



========
7/12/2023	
--------
Need to add a max health value cause everything has a max health and a current health

I cannot think of a cleverer way to do this without like revamping my stats system...
Maybe have stats into a dictionary instead, that way can look for certain values and update them...

So what i will do is, add a function somewhere, probably internally in the basetoweruserlogic class that allows it to modify a variable
So the upgradeclass unique to the tower will get the component and just get abstract class (BaseTower whatever) and call that function,
things should work

The function takes in key value pair and tries to update the towers key to the new value...

Since I cannot see dictionaries in Unity... it will be a bit messy to adjust values in inspector and then have it copied in dictionary

IDamageable, no health parameter since it will be covered in the stats dictionary



IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USING VARIABLE OF DYNAMIC
---------------------------------------------

Do i even need singletons?

Too lazy to add in a play button like bloonstd, just gonna make it auto spawn like plants vs zombies

Work on skill tree...
I am just gonna brute force it because i am lazy

What i understand of what i was going to do for my skill tree is that, all possible skill upgrades are on tower
as an array of classes that can be instantiated on the tower

two arrays full of classes

Test tower upgrades
-----------------
Early game path:
Increase stats, change projectile speed

Late game path
Change Tower from one shooters to two shooters, make shooters stronger
