Goals: Art, Project development pipline structure (learning to reuse code, streamline things)
-Manage camera resolution

Goal: Release the 40 wave mode, in one area

Links I think to look at:

-Things to do: How to place object on top of tile, but only on certain tiles... (DONE)
Shop

NOTE: Make sure there is tile covering everywhere, I don't see how player could click on not a tile in game

UI:
Main UI
---------
Health, Currency, Fastfoward

Tower UI
---------
Health, Damage, Sell Cost, Upgrade

Tower Upgrade System
Districts?: If certain towers are built together than bonuses can apply
Support Towers

How many towers in game? 35, but a lot of upgrades, 5 upgrades???

Will have one purchasing manager but the shops will be different when player moves to new area
The create items function (just like in the 'ShopGame') will be used to add elements in, add tabs for new towers in specific areas (this for later)

Need to have camera movement with mouse

Conditions for new towers, add towers in through scripts, codemonkey way.  This will help with adding towers the scroll bar and spawning towers on grid

Need to play that isometric tower defense game again, to see how they did it


========

need to add camera panning with mouse

Thinking about how to add items to the ShopList and for Spawning.  How do i set up GameAssetsHolderManager, dictionary with SO?

Will upgraded towers be their own SO?
When will shop add new items?  Just based on player currency?  Wave number?

Shop currently works

!!Need to get CodeMonkey Utilities script thing


What will enemies be like, simple tower that shoots one thing to closest player tower and another tower that is aoe
This will be reusing methods for the player tower since they also shoot the same way
EnemyAI Path will be a prefab with a script on it, just attach it to all enemies in the certain zone


So enemy towers are like real gameobjects that can float along, have to test that.  They will have same stats as tower
Player towers are just tiles, upgrades are new tiles or just replacing the sprite?  How does this relate to the SO?  I need SO for sure

I am thinking, tile initially gets data from SO... all the data including sprites.  When the player clicks on that tile to upgrade and stuff =>
=> then it will look at SO for the new upgraded sprite

Enemy towers will just have gameobject sprite as their image, lets just give them an SO

So all the basic info towers have will be struct.  The player tower will have additional information such as price buildspace and such


))Scope creep?  Lanes that are 3x3 so enemies can have 3x3 towers? or just several 1x1 towers?

Watched video to understand tilemap more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TY0F7Zm6Lc

Will make 40 level wave prototype without URP.  Will work on upgrading later

Going to add mouse panning and try to make tower functional with enemies too

Tilemap Optimization: Put unity tiles in individual mode while editoring but put it back to chunk when buildilng...
- ALSO put the tiles in a sprite atlas or something....

Have shop glow new tower when player gets cetain amount of currency
Have to manually set tiles to have to be on certain layer in order for blocks to look like they are behind or infront of a wall

Made shop work and camera work...

How is player gonna click on UI without the camera moving all over the place?  Maybe have player need to press a button that let games know okay, move camera?

========

--------
make basic tower shoot, make placing tower work, make shop button work, make description work, make adding towers work (also adding the notification of a new tower), make wave system somewhere (including spawner and figure out how waves work...)

Not sure if LevelHandler Scritp will be the best but can refactor later

Make tower show radius, do i have to manually tell game where the center of the tower is?

I think I do, will have to have two towers, square and notsquare. 		

Things to do:

make tower radius with 1x1 tower
make basic tower shoot, 
make placing tower work (multiple tile take up),
make tower radius with other tower sizes


make shop button work, 
make description work, 
make adding towers work (also adding the notification of a new tower), 
make wave system somewhere (including spawner and figure out how waves work...)


THINGS TO FOCUS ON:
Spawn only one ring, or figureout some kinda of system to handle that.  Need deslect thing to work

Make a second tower because hover thing is making things complicated


Tower ofo same time not working for some reason... I think i need tilebase reference, not if towertile is same

FINISHED THE THINGS TO FOCUS ON, used a helper function



https://youtu.be/0x4EigFnWws?t=495 i think this will help me with adding tower thingy thingy or look up code monkey as well

Wait how do i even make tower hit closest thing correctly in a 2d environment?  Okay having 2d sprite at angle is my solution kinda 

Okay i have attackhandler on towerstruct but i think can refactor later for support towers
Probably have abstract class of basic towerradiusmanager and then classes for attacking or supporting
Base abstract class is just get things in radius?

Need to change attack radius to be overlapping the actual circle. Spawn the circle with the attack handling sript on it.  Maybe play a little animation when building tower to give some time to spawn

Okay so i fixed radius thing


========

make basic tower shoot, also thinking about how to destroy tower
make placing tower work (multiple tile take up),


make shop button work, 
make description work, 
make adding towers work (also adding the notification of a new tower), 
make wave system somewhere (including spawner and figure out how waves work...)


Maybe have a mechanic where player can send an airplane to uh send bombs to heal player towers or damage enemies
Change camera size?

Need to add spawn point of bullets.  Maybe cool for towers with multiple spawn points

Gonna see if i can make towers preplaced in editor without casuing error, it annoying for testing and probably future feature

Redo code: Turns out, tile, is not a good place to have logic in
Tower and radius on the cursor when player buying will be a seperate object...

Need to go on website called the Medium to see how i can make tiles store individual data...



Okay. Maybe this, have grid handler handle sprites but spawn in the radius destroying thing there.
Have to add custom hitbox to player towers that allow enemies to hit the player towers and allow player to destroy them

I think spawning radius with other towers not issue since it all be custom

Destroy tower should be a menu option actually, when clicking on it.
Made helper function to destroy any tile at specific location, used in TowerLogicHandler and in destroying tower in the menu

Need to work on shop so i can make mouse switch from buildng mode to just clicking mode...

REVAMP: Make game entergunegon 2d look but its actually 3d

The camera will be rotated to look isometric and sprites will have to be isometric as well, not sure how it will look when tower 
which will be issue at all angles


Review what I have done: Camera, UI

Implementing Old Systems back into this new revamp

Okay done...

Try to do the new tile system with spawning gameobjects instead of the dumb map
I wonder how I can do elevated layers but worry about that later, can just spawn tiles on their or put them there manually

Okay need to learn more about optimizing rn, learn unity occulsion culling
When player go to new area, it will have to be unity dots i guess

Need to make every other tile a different color bvecause grahical bug, colliders touching each other or something...


Things to do:

make shop button work, 
make description work, 
Make placing tower work (along with radius management, showing it when placing and lcicking and stuff)

make basic tower shoot, also thinking about how to destroy tower
make placing tower work (multiple tile take up),
radius on tower bigger than 1x1


make adding towers work (also adding the notification of a new tower), 
make wave system somewhere (including spawner and figure out how waves work...)

Basically rn, working on gamemanager and game states, made the pause and speed up work, distracted from trying to fnish build mode in game

Review codemonkey building tiles thing

So far the only input from player is just using the mouse, and then it will be R to rotate... and escape to escape things...

Need to have multiple sprites for cursor and the prefab in the game in a tower. cursor sprite does not work with an ingame tower sprite

Okay basically finsihed game states..., just some todos for the pause vicotry and gameover screen


When player rotates camera, i guess i gotta just change the sprite to the next rotation versino cause they could have the truned sprite when they turn
an object in the normal view angle
